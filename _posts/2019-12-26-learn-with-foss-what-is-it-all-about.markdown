Computer Science Students/Graduates who learn the basic concepts from textbooks and lectures are often unaware of the real-world scenarios where these concepts are applied.  Free and Open-Source Softwares (FOSS) which are extensively used by the academia and the industry provides a treasure trove of information about the usage of computer science concepts in real-world scenarios.

This blog is an attempt to introduce real-world implementations of data structures and algorithms by exploring the source code of free and open-source software. We aim to use this blog as a space for sharing some use-cases in the context of famous software like PostgreSQL, Linux Kernel etc. and the implementations of various data structures, algorithms etc. used to solve them.
